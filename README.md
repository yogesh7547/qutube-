   or
   yarn install

3. Configure environment variables in `.env` (create from `.env.example`):
   - PORT (default: 8000)
   - DATABASE_URL (MongoDB connection string)
   - JWT_SECRET
   - JWT_EXPIRES_IN, JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN
   - STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH or S3 credentials
   - FFMPEG_PATH (if using local transcoding)
   - REDIS_URL (optional)

## Running the Server

- Development:
  npm run dev

- Production:
  npm run build
  npm start

Default PORT is 8000 unless overridden in .env.

## Tech Stack
- Runtime: Node.js
- Framework: Express.js
- Database: MongoDB (Mongoose)
- Authentication: JWT (access + refresh)
- File Upload: Multer (local or S3)
- Video Processing: ffmpeg (worker)
- Optional: Redis for jobs/caching
- Testing: Jest + Supertest
- Linting/Formatting: ESLint + Prettier

## Development Scripts (package.json)
- npm run dev — start dev server (nodemon)
- npm run build — build transpiled code (if using TypeScript)
- npm start — start production server
- npm test — run tests
- npm run worker — start background worker (transcoding/jobs)

## Middleware
- Auth middleware — verifies JWT tokens for protected routes
- Multer middleware — handles multipart uploads with validation
- Rate limiter — protect sensitive endpoints (uploads/auth)
- Validation middleware — request body validation (Joi/Zod)

## Database Models (examples)
- User
- Video
- Tweet
- Comment
- Like
- Playlist
- Subscription
- Job (transcoding / processing)

## Storage & Video Processing
- Uploads stored locally or in S3-compatible storage
- Worker picks up raw uploads, runs ffmpeg to transcode and generate HLS (m3u8 + segments)
- Serve HLS from a static file server or CDN
- Consider resumable uploads for large files (tus or chunked uploads)

## Security
- JWT-based authentication and refresh flow
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Input validation & sanitization
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting on auth and upload endpoints
- Store secrets in environment variables (do not commit .env)

## Testing
- Unit tests with Jest
- Integration tests with Supertest (use test DB and teardown)
- CI should run lint, tests, and build
